# CV - Anita Amini 

I am a developer who enjoys writing Javascript and Node.js. I am not afraid to get my hands dirty to find the most suitable solutions for the projectâ€™s requirements. 

Ultimately, my goal is to become awesome at writing simple, robust, scalable and readable code - through practice, learning and applying different programming paradigms, and by studying the approaches of other developers.
