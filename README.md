# CV - Anita Amini 

I am a developer who likes writing Javascript and Node.js. I enjoy working on different parts of the stack such as the front-end logic, querying databases and writing RESTful APIs. I am not afraid to get my hands dirty to find the most suitable solutions for the projectâ€™s requirements. I am currently learning Go and finding it really fun.

Ultimately, my goal is to become awesome at writing simple, robust, scalable and readable code - through practice, learning and applying different programming paradigms, and by studying the approaches of other developers.

I also love vim.
